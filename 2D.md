## Shared

**x**: Anchor point's 'x' coordinate

**y**: Anchor point's 'y' coordinate

**type**: See [Shapes](./Shapes.md)

**layer**: layers are used to separate drawing elements into groups, determine rendering order, and to assign attributes

## Rectangles ("rect")

**x**: The x position of the top left corner of the rectangle.
**y**: The y position of the top left corner of the rectangle.
**width**: The width of the rectangle
**height**: The height of the rectangle
**rx**: The x radius of the corners of the rectangle
**ry**: The y radius of the corners of the rectangle

## Circle ("circle")

**r**: The radius of the circle.
**cx**: The x position of the center of the circle.
**cy**: The y position of the center of the circle.


## Ellipse

**rx**: The x radius of the ellipse.
**ry**: The y radius of the ellipse.
**cx**: The x position of the center of the ellipse.
**cy**: The y position of the center of the ellipse.

## Line

**x1**: The x position of point 1.
**y1**: The y position of point 1.
**x2**: The x position of point 2.
**y2**: The y position of point 2.

## Polyline

Polylines are groups of connected straight lines. Since that list can get quite long, all the points are included in one attribute:

**points**: A list of points, each number separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character. Each point must contain two numbers, an x coordinate and a y coordinate. So the list (0,0), (1,1) and (2,2) could be written: "0 0, 1 1, 2 2".

## Polygon

Polygons are a lot like polylines in that they're composed of straight line segments connecting a list a points. For polygons though, the path automatically returns to the first point for you at the end, creating a closed shape. Note that a rectangle is a type of polygon, so a polygon can be used to create a <rect/> element in cases where you need a little more flexibility.

**points**: A list of points, each number separated by a space, comma, EOL, or a line feed character. Each point must contain two numbers, an x coordinate and a y coordinate. So the list (0,0), (1,1) and (2,2) could be written: "0 0, 1 1, 2 2". The drawing then closes the path, so a final straight line would be drawn from (2,2) to (0,0).

## Path

Path is probably the most general shape that can be used in SVG. Using a path element you can draw rectangles (with or without rounded corners), circles, ellipses, polylines, and polygons. Basically any of the other types of shapes, bezier curves, quadratic curves, and many more. For that reason, paths alone will be the next section in this tutorial, but for now I will just point out that there is a single attribute used to control its shape.

**d**: A list of points and other information about how to draw the path. See the Paths section for more information.
